An interactive essay explaining Bell's theorem in non-technical language.
You can play with it [here](http://freelanceastro.github.io/bell).
Created as an online component to go with my book, [_What Is Real? The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics_](http://freelanceastrophysicist.com/whatisreal), published in 2018 by [Basic Books](http://basicbooks.com).
If you do something cool with this repo, or find it useful in any way, please do let me know. You can send me an [email](http://freelanceastrophysicist.com/contact) or find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/freelanceastro).
And if you want to yell at me for getting Bell's theorem wrong or something like that, feel free to drop me a line. But be warned: I can drone on about this stuff for a really long time. You might even say I could write a book on it.
